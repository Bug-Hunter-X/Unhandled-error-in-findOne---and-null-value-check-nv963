# MongoDB findOne() Asynchronous Operation Error Handling and Null Value Check

This repository demonstrates a common error when using MongoDB's `findOne()` method: not properly handling potential errors and null results.  The `findOne()` operation is asynchronous; therefore, errors and lack of results need to be carefully handled.  This example showcases the problem and its solution.

## Bug

The original code doesn't handle the case where an error occurs during the database operation or when no document matches the query. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
